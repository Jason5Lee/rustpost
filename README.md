# Rustpost

A posting web demo using Rust and actix-web, with my opinionated designing.

## Project Dir

* [api](./api) is the RESTful API service.
* [createadmin](./createadmin) is the CLI tool for creating admin.

## TODO

- [ ] Server-side rendering web app.
- [ ] Client-side rendering using React.
- [ ] Mobile app?

## Special Thanks

* [Scott Wlaschin](https://scottwlaschin.com/) and [his wonderful book](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/) which inspire me a lot.
