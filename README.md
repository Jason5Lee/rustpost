# Rustpost

The REST service that allows users to create, view and manage posts.

## Projects

* [rustpost REST API](./restapi) is the RESTful API service. It uses Rust and actix-web, based on [the Domain Modeling idea from Scott Wlaschin](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/) and some of my ideas.
* [createadmin](./createadmin) is the CLI tool for creating admin.

## Special Thanks

* [Scott Wlaschin](https://scottwlaschin.com/) and [his wonderful book](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/) which inspire me a lot.
